# General Info
This project is the craziest I've already done. Just drone was too boring, so I came up with the idea of a flying spud gun. There were no projects like this on the internet, and I had to develop everything on my own. For that reason, there are still many things to improve. The budget was also small. That wooden legs are on this account.

## Drone
The hexacopter platform was designed and assembled by me some years ago. Hence, some of the parts are no longer available.
Parts I used:
- 

## Spud gun
The way spud guns work is plain. Flammable gas is set on fire by a spark, then expanding gas pushes out the missile (potato).
Parts I used:

## Connecting
This was the easiest part. All parts you need are a relay and some zip-ties.
