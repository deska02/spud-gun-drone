## General Info
Firstly, all this project is for fun. Be careful and have fun!
Some years ago, after assembling a hexacopter, I concluded that homemade drone sucks in comparison to DJI. Hence, I had to do something crazy with it. Hours of watching youtube inspired me to do something unique. There were no projects like this on the internet, and I had to develop everything on my own. For that reason, there are still many things to improve. The budget was also small (that wooden legs are on this account). 

## Drone
The hexacopter platform was designed and assembled by me about 3 years ago. Hence, some of the parts are no longer available.

Parts I used:
- hexa frame
- apm 2.6 with gps and power module
- 6x emax 2213-935KV motor with 1045 propeller (850g thrust each)
- 6x simonk30A esc
- Flysky FS-i6 radio with FS-ia6b receiver
- 5000mAh li-poly battery
- power distribution board (easier to assembly and modify than solder)
After hours spent in the air I can honestly say, that all the parts are really reliable aside from flight controller.


## Spud gun
The way spud guns work is plain. Flammable gas is set on fire by a spark, then expanding gas pushes out the missile (potato).
Parts I used:

## Connecting
This was the easiest part. All parts you need are a relay and some zip-ties.
