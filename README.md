## General Info
Firstly, all this project is for fun. Be careful and have fun!
Some years ago, after assembling a hexacopter, I concluded that homemade drone sucks in comparison to DJI. Hence, I had to do something crazy with it. Hours of watching youtube inspired me to do something unique. There were no projects like this on the internet, and I had to develop everything on my own. For that reason, there are still many things to improve. The budget was also small (that wooden legs are on this account). 

## Drone
The hexacopter platform was designed and assembled by me about 3 years ago. Hence, some of the parts are no longer available.

Parts I used:
- Hexa frame
- APM 2.6 with GPS and power module
- 6x Emax 2213-935KV motor with 1045 propeller (850g thrust each)
- 6x simonk30A ESC
- Flysky FS-i6 radio with FS-ia6b receiver
- 5000mAh li-poly battery
- power distribution board (easier to assembly and modify than solder)

Overall weight is about 2kg without additional stuff (no camera and gimbal) when thrust is 5,1kg. That means there is more than 1kg of free space available for the user.
After hours spent in the air, I can honestly say that all the parts are reliable aside from the flight controller. 

**Please remember to calibrate ESC before flight!**

## Spud gun
The way spud guns work is plain. Flammable gas is set on fire by a spark, then expanding gas pushes out the missile (potato).

Parts I used:
- ⌀32 pipe
- ⌀40 to ⌀32 reducer
- ⌀50 to ⌀40 reducer
- ⌀50 inspection
- ⌀50 socket plug
- 2 screws 
- duck tape
- old lighter with piezoelectric transducer (just for gun tests)
- 15kv transformator, 3,7 battery and button

## Connecting
This was the easiest part. All parts you need are a relay and some zip-ties.
